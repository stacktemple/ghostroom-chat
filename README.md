GhostRoom Chat is an open-source, real-time chatroom system  
crafted for **anonymous gatherings and hidden conversations**.

Anyone can **step into a room** or **create one without revealing their identity**‚Äîno login, no sign-up.

Each **browser session becomes a unique guest**, verified by a **token valid for a single day**.  
At **midnight (GMT+7)**, all rooms, guests, and messages are **cleansed**, as if they were never there.

This design embraces **temporary presence** and **vanishing dialogue**,  
perfect for fleeting talks, secret strategies, or casual discussions with no strings attached.

## Key Features

- Real-time messaging over WebSocket
- Guest-only access without registration
- One guest identity per browser session, valid for one day
- Create open or password-protected rooms
- Automatic data reset at midnight (GMT+7)
- Stateless architecture powered by JWT
- PostgreSQL as the only persistence layer (no Redis)
- Fully dockerized for both development and production

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Go, Fiber, WebSocket, JWT, sqlx
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16
